## User Story
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

## Description: SQL, Employee Tracker
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). The task is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using `Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.`
Because this task will require the use of the Inquirer package, ensure that you install and use `Inquirer version 8.2.4.` To do so, use the following command in your project folder: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4.`
This application wonâ€™t be deployed, but a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality will be linked below and all of the acceptance criteria being met.

The codebase includes two files: `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql`. To create the necessary tables, please execute the command `node src/app.js` will start the build, command  `psql -U postgres` will get you to access the fucntion and create tables,at which point you will be prompted to enter a password. After successfully executing this command, you may proceed by running command: `progres=# exit` will stop your code. This step is essential; however, if you require a database populated with employee data, you may also execute `psql -U postgres -d empdb`.
